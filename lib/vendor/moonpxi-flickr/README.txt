== DESCRIPTION:

An insanely easy interface to the Flickr photo-sharing service. By Scott Raymond. (& updated May 08 by Chris Taggart, http://pushrod.wordpress.com)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

The flickr gem (famously featured in a RubyonRails screencast) had broken with Flickr's new authentication scheme and updated API.
This has now been largely corrected, though not all current API calls are supported yet.

== SYNOPSIS:

require 'flickr'
flickr = Flickr.new('some_flickr_api_key')    # create a flickr client (get an API key from http://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
user = flickr.users('sco@scottraymond.net')   # lookup a user
user.name                                     # get the user's name
user.location                                 # and location
user.photos                                   # grab their collection of Photo objects...
user.groups                                   # ...the groups they're in...
user.contacts                                 # ...their contacts...
user.favorites                                # ...favorite photos...
user.photosets                                # ...their photo sets...
user.tags                                     # ...their tags...
user.popular_tags							  							# ...and their popular tags
recentphotos = flickr.photos                  # get the 100 most recent public photos
photo = recentphotos.first                    # or very most recent one
photo.url                                     # see its URL,
photo.title                                   # title,
photo.description                             # and description,
photo.owner                                   # and its owner.
File.open(photo.filename, 'w') do |file|
  file.puts p.file                            # save the photo to a local file
end
flickr.photos.each do |p|                     # get the last 100 public photos...
  File.open(p.filename, 'w') do |f|
    f.puts p.file('Square')                   # ...and save a local copy of their square thumbnail
  end
end
